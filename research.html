      <h3>Solving Maximum Independent Set using Variational Quantum Algorithms</h3>
      <p>In this project, I perform a comparison study of various Variational Quantum Algorithms for the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. More specifically, I compare the use of Variational Quantum Eigensolve (VQE), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Adaptive Derivative Assembled Problem Tailored-QAOA (ADAPT-QAOA), and Digitized Counterdiabatic-QAOA (DC-QAOA) in solving the MIS problem. The study is performed using both noiseless and noisy simulators. In addition, error mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation and Twirled Readout Error extinction are used to study the effectiveness of the mitigation techniques when using noisy simulators.</p>

      <h3>Portfolio Optimization using Quantum Annealing and Variational Algorithms</h3>
      <p>In this project, I study the portfolio optimization problem using both gate-based (VQE) and quantum annealing approaches. Starting with a 0–1 mean-variance model under integer budget constraints, it extends to a discrete-weight mean-variance model, a discretized version of the original problem as proposed by Harry Markowitz. I use brute-force methods to obtain classical baselines, and use them to compare the performance of the quantum solvers. This study demonstrates how quantum optimization techniques can be used to address the combinatorial complexity of portfolio selection.</p>

      <h3>Query Complexity of k-shallow Quantum Circuits</h3>
      <p><strong>Collaborators:</strong> Dr. Debajyoti Bera, Dr. Jaikumar Radhakrishnan, Dr. Rohit Sarma Sarkar</p>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong> In this project, we investigate the query complexity of decision problems when on has access to shallow quantum circuits. A <em>k</em>-shallow quantum circuit is a circuit that makes atmost <em>k</em> oracle queries to the input and forcibly performs a measurement after the last query. When <em>k</em> is smaller than the optimal query complexity <strong>Q</strong>, it is expected that any algorithm with this restriction will require queries more than <strong>Q</strong>. In this work, we aim to lower bound the number of queries that any algorithm would need to make to solve the problem of interest if the algorithm can only use <em>k</em>-shallow quantum circuits.</p>
