        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Tharrmashastha SAPV and I am currently finishing my Ph.D in Computer Science at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology - Delhi, India. My doctoral advisor is Dr.Debajyoti Bera. I completed my masters degree in Mathematics at Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan, India.<br><br>

My research spans multiple lines, including query-space tradeoff-complexity, variational quantum algorithms, the theory of superconducting transmons, and quantum cryptography. My PhD thesis focuses on exploring the query–space trade-offs in quantum algorithms for decision problems, providing both theoretical insights and practical implications for quantum computing. I am a Qiskit Advocate and a contributor to Qiskit SDK.<br><br>
